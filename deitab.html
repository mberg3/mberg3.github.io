						<h2>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</h2>
					</header>
					<p>I believe academia can be a force for good in our world through providing science learning when it is otherwise inaccessible,
					   recruiting people with diverse backgrounds to solve diverse problems, and establishing a base understanding of 
					   science and scientific literacy in the public. I am pursuing a scientific career, so academia will be my main sphere of 
					   influence. If I want to see academia accomplish these goals, then I have a part to play in this work. 
					   In this regard, I have created concrete plans and action steps that I have detailed below for the next several years of my career.
					   I hold a postdoctoral position at the University of Texas at Austin, and my current career plan is to pursue a faculty position. 
                       At each position, I will better tailor these actions steps to the institute where I am located.
					   <!--I am seeking a postdoctoral position after I obtain my Ph.D., and my current career plan is to pursue a faculty position.
