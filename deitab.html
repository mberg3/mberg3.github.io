						<h2>Scientific Outreach</h2>
					</header>
					<p>I passionately believe that science is for everyone. Great scientists have learned information, techniques, and (most importantly) how to persevere.
					   Anyone can learn new skills and dive into a new topic. Astronomy is an incredibly powerful way to show people the wonder of science with the immense beauty of the universe.
					   I want to inspire people to think about how they can be a scientist in any STEM field that they are interested in. 
					   Outreach opens up the mind to new possibilities, and seeing role models allows someone to see themselves in that career too. 
					   As such, I look for ways to talk about my career journey and struggles with students and participate in events that showcase different STEM careers.

						<h2>Community and Belonging</h2>
					</header>
					<p>I believe academia can be a force for good in our world through providing science learning when it is otherwise inaccessible,
					   recruiting people with diverse perspectives to solve diverse problems, and establishing a base understanding of 
					   science and scientific literacy in the public. I am pursuing a scientific career, so academia will be my main sphere of 
					   influence. If I want to see academia accomplish these goals, then I have a part to play in this work. 
					   In this regard, I have created concrete plans and action steps that I have detailed below for the next several years of my career.
